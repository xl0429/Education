<h2><strong>With &lsquo;at&rsquo;</strong></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I&rsquo;m quite good at English but I&rsquo;m bad at maths and I&rsquo;m terrible at physics.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2><strong>With &lsquo;for&rsquo;</strong></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Jogging is good for your health but smoking is bad for you.</em></p>

<p><em>The town is famous for its cheese.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As well as &lsquo;<strong>good for</strong>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<strong>bad for</strong>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<strong>famous for</strong>&rsquo; we also say &lsquo;<strong>qualified for</strong>&rsquo; &lsquo;<strong>ready for</strong>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<strong>responsible for</strong>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<strong>suitable for</strong>&rsquo; and several others.</p>

<h2><strong>With &lsquo;of&rsquo;</strong></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I&rsquo;m perfectly capable of doing it myself, thank you.</em></p>

<p><em>I&rsquo;m very fond of this old sweatshirt.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As well as &lsquo;<strong>capable of</strong>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<strong>fond of</strong>&rsquo; we also say &lsquo;<strong>aware of</strong>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<strong>full of</strong>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<strong>tired of</strong>&rsquo; and several others.</p>

<h2><strong>With &lsquo;with&rsquo;</strong></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><em>We&rsquo;re very pleased with your progress.</em></p>

<p><em>You&rsquo;re not still angry with me are you?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As well as &lsquo;<strong>pleased with</strong>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<strong>angry with</strong>&rsquo; we also say &lsquo;<strong>bored with</strong>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<strong>delighted with</strong>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<strong>satisfied with</strong>&rsquo; and several others.</p>

<h2><strong>With &lsquo;to&rsquo;</strong></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><em>She&rsquo;s the one who&rsquo;s married to a doctor, isn&rsquo;t she?</em></p>

<p><em>You&rsquo;ll be responsible to the head of the Finance department.</em></p>

<p>Notice that you can be&nbsp;<strong>responsible fo</strong>r something but&nbsp;<strong>responsible to</strong>&nbsp;someone.</p>

<p>Other common adjective + preposition combinations include &lsquo;<strong>interested in</strong>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<strong>keen on</strong>&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s a good idea to make a note of new combinations in your vocabulary notebook as you meet them. Remember too that a preposition is followed by a noun or a gerund (&lsquo;ing&rsquo; form).</p>

<p>Adjectives that end &lsquo;-ed&rsquo; (e.g. &lsquo;<strong>bored</strong>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<strong>interested</strong>&rsquo;) and adjectives that end &lsquo;-ing&rsquo; (e.g. &lsquo;<strong>boring</strong>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<strong>interesting</strong>&rsquo;) are often confused.</p>

<p><strong>-ed adjectives</strong></p>

<p>Adjectives that end &lsquo;-ed&rsquo; describe emotions &ndash; they tell us how people feel about something.</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>I was very bored in the maths lesson. I almost fell asleep.</em></li>
	<li><em>He was surprised to see Helen. She&rsquo;d told him she was going to Australia.</em></li>
	<li><em>Feeling tired and depressed, he went to bed.</em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>-ing adjectives</strong></p>

<p>Adjectives that end &lsquo;-ing&rsquo; describe the thing that causes the emotion &ndash; a boring lesson makes you feel bored.</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>Have you seen that film? It&rsquo;s absolutely terrifying.</em></li>
	<li><em>I could listen to him for hours. He&rsquo;s one of the most interesting people I&rsquo;ve ever met.</em></li>
	<li><em>I can&rsquo;t eat this! It&rsquo;s disgusting! What is it?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Remember that people can be&nbsp;<strong>boring&nbsp;</strong>but only if they make other people feel&nbsp;<strong>bored</strong>.</p>

<ul>

<blockquote>
<p><em>What were you doing at 8 o&rsquo;clock last night? I was watching television.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I started watching television before 8 o&rsquo;clock and I continued watching it after 8 o&rsquo;clock.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>In 1994 he was working in a small town in Poland.</em></p>

<p><em>At 6 o&rsquo;clock on Saturday morning we were travelling to the airport.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>2. We often use the&nbsp;<strong>past continuous</strong>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<strong>past simple</strong>&nbsp;tense together. When this happens, the&nbsp;<strong>past continuous</strong>&nbsp;describes a longer, &lsquo;background&rsquo; action or situation and the<strong>&nbsp;past simple</strong>&nbsp;describes the action or events.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>When I woke up this morning it was raining and my father was singing in the kitchen.</em></p>

<p><em>I was walking home, whistling happily, when I saw two masked men run out of the bank.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Often, the &lsquo;action&rsquo; described by the&nbsp;<strong>past simple</strong>&nbsp;tense&nbsp;<em>interrupts&nbsp;</em>the &lsquo;situation&rsquo; described by the&nbsp;<strong>past continuous</strong>&nbsp;tense.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I broke my leg when I was skiing.</em></p>

<p><em>I was playing a computer game when the doorbell rang.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice that the&nbsp;<strong>past continuous</strong>&nbsp;describes &lsquo;situations&rsquo; that go on for some time &ndash; &lsquo;skiing&rsquo; and &lsquo;playing&rsquo; but the&nbsp;<strong>past simple</strong>&nbsp;describes &lsquo;actions&rsquo; that happen quickly &ndash; &lsquo;broke&rsquo; and &lsquo;rang&rsquo;.<br />
<br />
Notice too the important difference between these two sentences.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>When they arrived, Jeff was cooking dinner.&nbsp;</em>Jeff started cooking before they arrived.</p>

<p><em>When they arrived, Jeff cooked dinner.&nbsp;</em>Jeff started cooking dinner after they arrived.</p>

<p>Nouns can be countable or uncountable. When you learn a new noun you should make a note of whether it is countable or uncountable as we use different words with countables and uncountables.<br />
<br />
<strong>Countable nouns</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><em>There is a cat in the garden.</em></li>
	<li><em>There are some birds in the trees.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>For positive sentences we can use&nbsp;<strong>a/an</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>some&nbsp;</strong>(with a plural verb form)</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>There isn&rsquo;t a dog in the garden.</em></li>
	<li><em>There aren&rsquo;t any birds in the tree.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>For negatives we can use&nbsp;<strong>a/an</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>any&nbsp;</strong>(with a plural verb form).</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>Is there an orange on the tree?</em></li>
	<li><em>Are there any chairs in the garden?</em></li>
	<li><em>How many chairs are there?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>In questions we use&nbsp;<strong>a/an</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>any&nbsp;</strong>or&nbsp;<strong>how many</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Uncountable nouns</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><em>There is some milk on the floor.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Uncountable nouns have no plural. The verb form is singular and we use&nbsp;<strong>some</strong>.</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>Is there any sugar?</em></li>
	<li><em>How much wine is there?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>In questions we can use&nbsp;<strong>any&nbsp;</strong>or&nbsp;<strong>how much</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Other expressions of quantity</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><em>There are a lot of apples on the trees.</em></li>
	<li><em>There is a lot of snow on the road.</em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A lot of</strong>&nbsp;can be used with both countable and uncountable nouns.</p>

<ul>
	<li><s><em>Bill Gates has much money.</em></s></li>
</ul>

<p>Notice that we don&rsquo;t usually use &lsquo;<strong>much</strong>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<strong>many</strong>&rsquo; in positive sentences. We use &lsquo;<strong>a lot of</strong>&rsquo;.</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>Bill Gates has a lot of money.</em></li>

	<li><em>There&rsquo;s a lot of beer but there isn&rsquo;t much wine.</em></li>
	<li><em>There are a lot of carrots but there aren&rsquo;t many potatoes.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>We use&nbsp;<strong>not many</strong>&nbsp;with countable nouns and&nbsp;<strong>not much</strong>&nbsp;with uncountable nouns.<br />

Here we&rsquo;ll concentrate on 3 golden rules. Most mistakes with articles are made through breaking one of these rules.</p>

<p>1. When we say what people&rsquo;s jobs are, we use&nbsp;<strong>a</strong>/<strong>an</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><em>She&rsquo;s an architect.</em></li>
	<li><em>He&rsquo;s a doctor.</em></li>
	<li><em>My grandfather was a teacher.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>2. Singular, countable nouns always have an article &ndash;&nbsp;<strong>a</strong>/<strong>an&nbsp;</strong>or&nbsp;<strong>the&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; or another determiner (my, your, this, that etc.)<br />
<br />
Remember that we use the indefinite article -&nbsp;<strong>a</strong>/<strong>an&nbsp;</strong>- when we talk about something that is not definite.</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>I saw a good film yesterday. The listener doesn&rsquo;t know which film.</em></li>
	<li><em>There&rsquo;s a man at the door. We don&rsquo;t know who the man is.</em></li>
	<li><em>Do you want a drink? It&rsquo;s not a particular drink.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>&hellip; and we use the definite article -&nbsp;<strong>the&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; when we talk about something more certain.</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>I&rsquo;m going to take the dog for a walk. The dog is a pet &ndash; it&rsquo;s not just any dog.</em></li>
	<li><em>Have you seen the car key? Speaker and listener know which car. It&rsquo;s not just any car.</em></li>
	<li><em>They live in the house opposite ours. There&rsquo;s only one house opposite. It&rsquo;s not any house.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>3.&nbsp; When we talk about things in general we usually use a plural noun or an uncountable noun with&nbsp;<strong>no article</strong>.</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>Birds eat worms. NOT&nbsp;<s>The birds eat the worms</s>.</em></li>
	<li><em>Water flows downhill.</em></li>
	<li><em>Kangaroos live in Australia.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>BUT&nbsp;<em>We went to the zoo and saw the kangaroos</em>. These are particular kangaroos &ndash; not kangaroos in general.<br />

<h2><strong>Gradable</strong></h2>

<p>Gradable adjectives are adjectives like &lsquo;<strong>cold</strong>&rsquo; &lsquo;<strong>hot</strong>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<strong>frightened</strong>&rsquo;. You can be&nbsp;<em>very cold</em>&nbsp;or a&nbsp;<em>bit cold</em>. Gradable adjectives show that something can have different degrees.</p>

<h2><strong>Non-gradable</strong></h2>

<p>Non-gradable adjectives are adjectives like &lsquo;<strong>married</strong>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<strong>wooden</strong>&rsquo;. You can&rsquo;t be&nbsp;<em>very married</em>&nbsp;or a&nbsp;<em>bit married</em>. Non-gradable adjectives do not have different degrees.</p>

<p>Adjectives like &lsquo;<strong>terrifying</strong>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<strong>freezing</strong>&rsquo; &lsquo;<strong>amazing</strong>&rsquo; are also non-gradable adjectives. They already contain the idea of &lsquo;<strong>very</strong>&rsquo; in their definitions &ndash; &lsquo;<strong>freezing</strong>&rsquo; means &lsquo;<em>very cold</em>&rsquo; etc.</p>

<h2><strong>Using adverbs of degree</strong></h2>

<p>When we use adverbs of degree to modify adjectives we usually have to use different adverbs for gradable and non-gradable adjectives.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>NOT&nbsp;<s><em>I&rsquo;m completely hot</em></s><em>.</em></p>

<p>NOT&nbsp;<s><em>It was very fantastic</em></s><em>!</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2><strong>With gradable adjectives</strong></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s a bit cold in here. Shall I turn the fire on?</em></p>

<p><em>He&rsquo;s very interested in history. Why don&rsquo;t you buy him a history book?</em></p>

<p><em>This exercise is really difficult. I don&rsquo;t know any of the answers.</em></p>

<p><em>I&rsquo;m extremely tired. I&rsquo;m going to bed.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The adverbs a&nbsp;<strong>bit</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>very</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>really</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>extremely&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>quite&nbsp;</strong>can all be used with gradable adjectives.</p>

<h2><strong>With non-gradable adjectives</strong></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s absolutely freezing in here. Shall I turn the fire on?</em></p>

<p><em>He&rsquo;s completely fascinated by history. Why don&rsquo;t you buy him a history book?</em></p>

<p><em>This exercise is absolutely impossible.</em></p>

<p><em>That film is really terrifying. Don&rsquo;t go and see it on your own.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The adverbs&nbsp;<strong>absolutely&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>completely&nbsp;</strong>can be used with non-gradable adjectives.</p>

<p>Notice that&nbsp;<strong>really&nbsp;</strong>can be used with both gradable AND non-gradable adjectives.</p>

	<li><em>My sister&rsquo;s house.</em></li>
	<li><em>The dog&rsquo;s blanket.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>For things we use &lsquo;<strong>of</strong>&rsquo; (<em>the front of the car, NOT&nbsp;</em><s><em>the car&rsquo;s front</em></s>.)<br />
<br />
The position of the apostrophe depends on whether the noun is singular or plural. look at these two examples.</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>My friend&rsquo;s house.&nbsp;</em>This is about one friend.</li>
	<li><em>My friends&rsquo; house.</em>&nbsp;This is about two or more friends who share a house.</li>
</ul>

<p>If a plural noun does not end in &lsquo;<strong>s</strong>&rsquo; (<em>e.g. men, people, children</em>) we use&nbsp;<strong>&lsquo;s</strong>&nbsp;to show possession.</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>The children&rsquo;s bedroom.</em></li>
	<li><em>A pair of women&rsquo;s sunglasses.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>We also use an apostrophe in some time expressions.</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>two weeks&rsquo; holiday</em></li>
	<li><em>ten years&rsquo; experience</em></li>
</ul>

<br />
<strong>Grammar</strong><br />
<br />
Americans use the&nbsp;<strong>present perfect</strong>&nbsp;tense less than speakers of British English and a British teacher might mark wrong some things that an American teacher would say are correct.</p>

<ul>
	<li><em><strong>US&nbsp;</strong>Did you do your homework yet?</em></li>
	<li><em><strong>Brit</strong>. Have you done your homework yet?</em></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><em><strong>US&nbsp;</strong>I already ate.</em></li>
	<li><em><strong>Brit</strong>. I&rsquo;ve already eaten.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>In British English, &lsquo;<strong>have got</strong>&rsquo; is often used for the possessive sense of &lsquo;<strong>have</strong>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<strong>have got to</strong>&rsquo; is informally used for &lsquo;<strong>have to</strong>&rsquo;. This is much less common in American English.</p>

<ul>
	<li><em><strong>Brit</strong>. I&rsquo;ve got two sisters.</em></li>
	<li><em><strong>US&nbsp;</strong>I have two sisters.</em></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><em><strong>Brit</strong>. I&rsquo;ve got to go now.</em></li>
	<li><em><strong>US&nbsp;</strong>I have to go now.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>There are a number of other minor grammatical differences.<br />
<br />
<strong>Vocabulary</strong><br />
<br />
There are a lot of examples of different words being used in British and American English. Here are a few of the commonest.</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>angry (<strong>Brit</strong>.) = mad (<strong>US</strong>)</em></li>
	<li><em>autumn = fall</em></li>
	<li><em>boot (of a car) = trunk</em></li>
	<li><em>chemist&rsquo;s = drug store</em></li>
	<li><em>cupboard = closet</em></li>
	<li><em>flat = apartment</em></li>
	<li><em>lift = elevator</em></li>
	<li><em>nappy = diaper</em></li>
	<li><em>pavement = sidewalk</em></li>
	<li><em>petrol = gas/gasoline</em></li>
	<li><em>rubbish = trash</em></li>
	<li><em>tap = faucet</em></li>
	<li><em>trousers = pants</em></li>
</ul>

<p>There are British words which many Americans will not understand and vice versa. There are also words which exist in both British and American English but have very different meanings.<br />
<br />
<strong>Spelling</strong><br />
<br />
There are also a number of different spelling rules between British English and American English.<br />
<br />
1 Some words that end in &lsquo;<strong>-tre</strong>&rsquo; in British English end in &lsquo;<strong>-ter</strong>&rsquo; in American English.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li><em><strong>US&nbsp;</strong>theater, center</em></li>
	<li><em><strong>Brit</strong>. theatre, centre</em></li>
</ul>

<p>2 Some words that end in &lsquo;<strong>-our</strong>&rsquo; in British English end in &lsquo;<strong>-or</strong>&rsquo; in American English.</p>

<ul>
	<li><em><strong>US&nbsp;</strong>color, labor</em></li>
	<li><em><strong>Brit</strong>. colour, labour</em></li>
</ul>

<p>3 Some words are shorter in American English than in British English.</p>

<ul>
	<li><em><strong>US&nbsp;</strong>catalog, program</em></li>
	<li><em><strong>Brit</strong>. catalogue, programme</em></li>
</ul>

<p>There are other minor spelling differences between British and American English.</p>

<h3><strong>Future continuous</strong></h3>

<ul>
	<li><em>Don&rsquo;t ring at 8 o&rsquo;clock. I&rsquo;ll be watching Who Wants to be a Millionaire.</em></li>
	<li><em>This time tomorrow we&rsquo;ll be sitting on the beach. I can&rsquo;t wait!</em></li>
</ul>

<p>We use the future continuous to talk about something that will be in progress at or around a time in the future.</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>Don&rsquo;t phone grandma now, she&rsquo;ll be having dinner.</em></li>
	<li><em>The kids are very quiet. They&rsquo;ll be doing something wrong, I know it!</em></li>
</ul>

<p>These sentences are not about the future but we can use the future continuous to talk about what we&nbsp;<em>assume&nbsp;</em>is happening at the moment.</p>

<h3><strong>Future Perfect</strong></h3>

<ul>
	<li><em>Do you think you will have finished it by next Thursday?</em></li>
	<li><em>In 5 years time I&rsquo;ll have finished university and I&rsquo;ll be able to earn some money at last.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>We use the future perfect to say that something will be finished by a particular time in the future.<br />
<br />
We often use the future perfect with &lsquo;<strong>by</strong>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<strong>in</strong>&rsquo;</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>I think astronauts will have landed on Mars by the year 2020.</em></li>
	<li><em>I&rsquo;ll have finished in an hour and then you can use the computer.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>&lsquo;<strong>By</strong>&rsquo; means &lsquo;<em>not later than a particular time</em>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<strong>in</strong>&rsquo; means &#39;<em>within a period of time</em>&rsquo;. We don&rsquo;t know exactly when something will finish.</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>I promise I&rsquo;ll have done all the work by next Saturday.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>We don&rsquo;t know&nbsp;<em>exactly&nbsp;</em>when he will finish the work &ndash; maybe Thursday, maybe Friday &ndash; but definitely before Saturday.&nbsp;</p>

INSERT INTO [dbo].[GrammarType] ([GrammarCode], [Title], [Description], [Rating], [Level], [RateCount]) VALUES (N'G0013', N'Past perfect', N'<p>When we talk about something that happened in the past we sometimes want to refer back to something that happened before that time. We can use the&nbsp;<strong>past perfect&nbsp;</strong>tense (<strong>had + past participle</strong>) to do this.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
Look at these two sentences.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>John left the house at 7:30 yesterday morning.</em></li>
	<li><em>Mary rang John&rsquo;s doorbell at 8:15 yesterday.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Both actions happened in the past so we use the&nbsp;<strong>past simple</strong>&nbsp;tense. But look at how we can combine the sentences.</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>Mary rang John&rsquo;s doorbell at 8:15 yesterday but John had already left the house.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>We use the&nbsp;<strong>past perfect&nbsp;</strong>(<em>had left</em>) because the action happened&nbsp;<em>before&nbsp;</em>another action in the past (<em>Mary rang the doorbell.</em>)<br />
<br />
Look at some more examples of the&nbsp;<strong>past perfect</strong>.</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>When Mrs Brown opened the washing machine she realised she had washed the cat.</em></li>
	<li><em>I got a letter from Jim last week. We&rsquo;d been at school together but we&rsquo;d lost touch with each other.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The&nbsp;<strong>past perfect</strong>&nbsp;is used because they were at school&nbsp;<em>before&nbsp;</em>he received the letter. It refers to an earlier past.<br />
<br />
Look at these 2 sentences.</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>James had cooked breakfast when we got up.</em></li>
	<li><em>James cooked breakfast when we got up.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>In the first sentence, the past perfect tells us that James cooked breakfast&nbsp;<em>before&nbsp;</em>we got up. In the second sentence, first we got up and then James cooked breakfast.<br />
<br />
<strong>Past perfect continuous</strong><br />
<br />
The&nbsp;<strong>past perfect</strong>&nbsp;can also be used in the continuous.</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>I realised I had been working too hard so I decided to have a holiday.</em></li>
	<li><em>By the time Jane arrived we had been waiting for 3 hours.</em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong><br />
The most common mistake with the past perfect is to overuse it or to use it simply because we are talking about a time in the distant past.</p>

<p>For example we would&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;say</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The Romans had spoken Latin</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>but rather</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The Romans spoke&nbsp;Latin</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>because it simply describes a past event, and not an event before and relevant to another past event.</p>

<p>Remember that we only use the past perfect when we want to refer to a past that is&nbsp;<em>earlier&nbsp;</em>than another time in the narrative.</p>

INSERT INTO [dbo].[GrammarType] ([GrammarCode], [Title], [Description], [Rating], [Level], [RateCount]) VALUES (N'G0014', N'Present Perfect', N'<p>The&nbsp;<strong>present perfect&nbsp;</strong>tense has a number of uses.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1 We use it to talk about experience.</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>I&rsquo;ve worked in 6 different countries.</em></li>
	<li><em>Have you ever been to Australia?</em></li>
	<li><em>She&rsquo;s won many awards for her books.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>When these things happened is not important &ndash; the focus is on the action/state, not when it happened.<br />
<br />
<strong>NB&nbsp;</strong>If we say when we had the experience, we must use the&nbsp;<strong>past simple</strong>.</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>I&rsquo;ve visited Russia several times.</em></li>
	<li><strong>BUT&nbsp;</strong><em>I visited Russia for the first time in 1992.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>We can never use the&nbsp;<strong>present perfect</strong>&nbsp;with a time in the past.</p>

<ul>
	<li><s><em>I have been to Spain in 2002.</em></s></li>
</ul>

<p>2 We also use the&nbsp;<strong>present perfect</strong>&nbsp;to talk about things that are unfinished &ndash; unfinished states and unfinished time periods.</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>I&rsquo;ve known him since I was 11</em>. (unfinished state)</li>
</ul>

<p>I met him when I was 11. I still know him now. The&nbsp;<strong>present perfect</strong>&nbsp;is acting as a bridge between the past and the present.</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>I&rsquo;ve had this watch for almost thirty years.</em></li>
	<li><em>We&rsquo;ve lived here since I was a boy.</em></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><em>She&rsquo;s been to the cinema three times this week.</em>&nbsp;(unfinished time period)</li>
</ul>

<p>This week isn&rsquo;t finished yet &ndash; she may go to the cinema again.</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>We&rsquo;ve already had two holidays this year.</em></li>
	<li><em>I&rsquo;ve eaten too much today.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>3 A third use of the&nbsp;<strong>present perfect</strong>&nbsp;is to show the present result of a past action</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>I&rsquo;ve lost my keys.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>He lost his keys some time in the past but the result &ndash; he can&rsquo;t get into his house &ndash; is in the present.</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>John&rsquo;s broken his leg and he can&rsquo;t go on holiday.</em></li>
	<li><em>A storm has blown down the telephone lines. We&rsquo;re stuck here!</em></li>
</ul>

INSERT INTO [dbo].[GrammarType] ([GrammarCode], [Title], [Description], [Rating], [Level], [RateCount]) VALUES (N'G0015', N'Present Perfect Simple and Present Perfect Continuous', N'<p>The present perfect simple suggests completion while the continuous suggests something is unfinished.</p>

<p>Present Perfect Simple and Present Perfect Continuous</p>

<p>We use the present perfect tense to talk about things where there is a connection between the past and the present.</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>He&rsquo;s written 16 books.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>He started writing books at some time in the past. So far, he has written 16 books. He may write more books.<br />
<br />
As well as the&nbsp;<strong>present perfect simple</strong>, we can use the&nbsp;<strong>present perfect continuous</strong>&nbsp;tense to talk about events with a connection to the present.<br />
<br />
1 Look at these 2 sentences:</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>I&rsquo;ve been decorating the house this summer.&nbsp;</em>The focus is on the action &ndash; decorating &ndash; and the action is unfinished.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><em>I&rsquo;ve painted the living room blue.&nbsp;</em>The focus is on the finished result. The activity is finished but we can see the result now.</li>
</ul>

<p>We use the&nbsp;<strong>present perfect continuous</strong>&nbsp;when the focus is on an activity that is unfinished.<br />
<br />
2 Look at these two sentences.</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>I&rsquo;ve read that book you lent me.&nbsp;</em>I finished it yesterday.</li>
	<li><em>I&rsquo;ve been reading that book you lent me.&nbsp;</em>I&rsquo;ve got another 50 pages to read.</li>
</ul>

<p>The&nbsp;<strong>present perfect simple</strong>&nbsp;(<em>I&rsquo;ve read</em>) gives the idea of completion while the&nbsp;<strong>present perfect continuous</strong>&nbsp;(<em>I&rsquo;ve been reading</em>) suggests that something is unfinished.<br />
<br />
3 Look at these two sentences.</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>She&rsquo;s been writing emails for 3 hours.</em></li>
	<li><em>She&rsquo;s written 10 messages.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The&nbsp;<strong>present perfect continuous</strong>&nbsp;(<em>has been writing</em>) talks about how long something has been happening. The&nbsp;<strong>present perfect simple</strong>&nbsp;(<em>has written</em>) talks about how much/how many have been completed.<br />
<br />
4 Look at these two sentences.</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>I&rsquo;ve worked here for thirty years.</em></li>
	<li><em>I usually work in London but I&rsquo;ve been working in Birmingham for the last 3 weeks.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>We can use the&nbsp;<strong>present perfect simple</strong>&nbsp;to talk about how long when we view something as permanent. But the&nbsp;<strong>present perfect continuous</strong>&nbsp;is often used to show that something is temporary.</p>
